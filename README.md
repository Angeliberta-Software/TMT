# TMT
An NVDA plugin for Meta Trader 5
Currently this is a super pre alpha testing version. Bugs are included.
## Requirements
 Meta Trader 5 x64
## Basic Navigation
###Focus
* Control+1: toolbox window.
* Control+2: data window.
* Control+3: navigator window.
* Control+4: market watch window.
* Control+5: workspace.
Appropriate checkboxes should be checked in the View menu.
Market watch window is currently very poorly accessible, but it is possible, for example, to call contract specification via context menu.
###Announce
* Control+P: current profile.
* Control+0: terminal current time.
* NVDA+T: announces active chart.
